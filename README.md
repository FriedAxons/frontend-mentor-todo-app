## Overview

The challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Design images and assets are provided.

Any tools you like to help you complete the challenge may be used. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode

**Bonus**:

1. ~~Drag and drop to reorder items on the list~~

2. ~~- Style drag and drop feature visually~~

**Made up bonus**: ~~This is not from the project itself, but for the extra challenge try adding something like local storage so the data persists for the user~~
